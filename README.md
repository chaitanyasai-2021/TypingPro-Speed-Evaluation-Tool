## 📖 Project Overview

**RapidType** is a Typing Speed Tester that calculates words per minute (WPM) over a 60-second timed session. The GUI displays words to type, tracks time, and calculates WPM. This project is perfect for anyone wanting to test or improve their typing speed.

## ✨ Features

- ⏲️ **Typing Timer**: 60-second countdown for each test session.
- 📄 **Real-time Word Display**: Shows typed words on the left and upcoming words on the right.
- 📊 **WPM Calculation**: Calculates words typed per minute and displays the result.
- 🖱️ **Interactive GUI**: Built with Tkinter for an engaging user experience.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language used for the application.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Random Module**: Generates random words for each test session, adding variety.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rapidtype-typing-speed-tester.git
   cd rapidtype-typing-speed-tester
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (Tkinter is pre-installed with Python):
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python typing_speed_tester.py
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Launch RapidType**: Open the application to start the typing test.
